# statistical-distributions-package

This is a package you can use to work with Normal (Gaussian) and Binomial Distributions.

The available functionalities are:
   1- Instantiating new Binomial or Gaussian distributions.
   2- Reading the distribution's data from a file.
   3- Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the data.
   4- Plot a histogram of the data using matplotlib.
   5- Calculte the probability density function and plot it.
   6- Add two distributions (Assuming equal event probability).
   7- Represent the distribution with its mean and standard deviation.
  
Any Suggestions and Contributions are welcome!
